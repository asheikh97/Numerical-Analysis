    "The <b>Gompertz curve</b> or Gompertz function, is a type of mathematical model named after Benjamin Gompertz (1779-1865). It is a function which describes growth as being slowest at the start and end of a given time period. Population biology is especially concerned with the Gompertz Function. This function is especially useful in describing the rapid growth of a certain population of organisms (such as tumors, bacteria, etc) while also being able to account for the eventual horizontal asymptote, once the carrying capacity is determined. The function was originally designed to describe human mortality, but since has been modified to be applied in biology, with regards to detailing populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is modeled as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N(t) = N_0 \\mathrm{exp}((\\ln (N_I/N_0)) (1-\\mathrm{exp}(-bt)) = N_0 e^{(\\ln \\frac{N_I}{N_0}) (1-e^{-bt})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t$ is the time, $N(t)$ is the population at time $t$, $N_0$ is the initial population, $N_I$ is the plateau population number (the maximum capacity in the given situation), $b$ is the initial growth rate, and $exp(x)$ is the exponential function $e^x$. The unit for $N(t)$, $N_I$, and $N_0$ are millions and the unit for $t$ is hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to write computer programs that determine the amount of time that it takes for $N(t)$ to rise from the inital population $N_0 = 3\\cdot 10^{-5}$ to $1$. We use $N_I = 10^3$ and $b = 0.12$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the solution of $N(t) = 1$ is equivalent to $N(t) - 1 = 0$, so this is a root finding problem.\n"
